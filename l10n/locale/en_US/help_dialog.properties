help.whyOpenstreetmap = <p><b>Why OpenStreetMap?</b> OSM is a mapping service in which all data is constantly updated and edited by everyday people like you. The obvious benefit is that it's free to use, but it has also become a major player in crisis mapping (e.g. use of OSM data to coordinate earthquake relief efforts in Haiti). Accuracy of this data is critical, and we hope you are able to volunteer some of your time!</p>
