Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
(last updated 30th November 2009)
-----------------------------------

== Code tidying ==

* A fair amount of the mouse-handling in each ControllerState is shared with others - 
  and some probably should be (e.g. unhovering). Can we refactor?


== Core geometry ==

* Delete points and ways
* Split and merge ways
* POI drawing (drag and drop/double-click)
* Undo/redo
* Reverse way direction


== Other core ==

* GPS tracks
* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support


== Server interaction ==


== UI ==

* Relations
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Background layer selection
* CSS style selection


== Tagging ==


== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* Needs some sort of _width attribute so we can draw highlights 2px wider than the largest stroke 
  (difficult because styles are decided before drawing)
* Shields
* Complete MapCSS support
